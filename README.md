# NameSorter

This is a simple name sorter built in C#/.NET 5.0. Given a list of unsorted names in a file "unsorted-names-list.txt", this application will sort the names by Last Name, then by Given Names and output the sorted names list in the console and into a file "sorted-names-list.txt".

## Build and Deployment
.NET 5.0 SDK is required to build this application.

Either VS Code (through commandline) or Visual Studio can be used to build this application.

## Usage
An input file, "unsorted-names-list.txt", containing the unsorted names (names separated by line) needs to be put in the same folder as the built executable.
Run the NameSorter.exe to sort and see the sorted names in the console.
Check the output file "sorted-names-list.txt" in the same folder to see the same output.
